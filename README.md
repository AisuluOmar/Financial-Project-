# Financial-Project

In this data project I will focus on exploratory data analysis of stock prices. This project is just meant to show my visualization and pandas skills, it is not meant to be a robust financial analysis or be taken as financial advice.  I'll focus on bank stocks and see how they progressed throughout the financial crisis all the way to early 2016.
